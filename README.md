A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company. This repository covers the end-to-end data science workflow, from exploratory data analysis to model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

### üìà Business Problem & Project Goal

In the competitive telecom industry, customer retention is a key driver of profitability. Acquiring a new customer is significantly more expensive than retaining an existing one.

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that accurately predicts which customers are most likely to churn (cancel their service). The insights from this model can empower the business to:
*   **Proactively identify** at-risk customers.
*   **Target** them with specific retention campaigns (e.g., discounts, special offers).
*   **Understand** the key factors that drive churn, enabling data-driven improvements to products and services.

### ‚ú® Key Results & Model Performance

The final Logistic Regression model achieved an **accuracy of 80.6%** on the unseen test set. More importantly, it successfully identified **56% of the actual churners (Recall)**, providing the business with a focused list of at-risk customers to target.

#### Confusion Matrix
![Confusion Matrix](img/confusion_matrix.png)

This matrix shows that the model correctly identified **209 churners** while also correctly identifying **926 loyal customers**.

### üíæ Data Source

The dataset used for this project is the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset from Kaggle. It contains customer account information, demographic data, and services they have signed up for.

*   **Source:** [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
*   **Size:** 7,043 customers (rows) √ó 21 features (columns).

### üî¨ Methodology

The project followed a structured machine learning workflow:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigated the relationships between customer attributes and churn. Visualized key features to identify patterns and potential predictors.
2.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
    *   Corrected data types (e.g., `TotalCharges` from object to numeric).
    *   Handled missing values using median imputation.
    *   Encoded the binary target variable `Churn` to 0s and 1s.
3.  **Feature Engineering & Pipeline:**
    *   Identified numerical and categorical features.
    *   Built a robust preprocessing pipeline using Scikit-learn's `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline`.
    *   **Numerical Features:** Scaled using `StandardScaler`.
    *   **Categorical Features:** Encoded using `OneHotEncoder`.
4.  **Model Training:**
    *   Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, using stratification to maintain the churn ratio.
    *   Trained a `LogisticRegression` model, a strong baseline for binary classification.
5.  **Model Evaluation:**
    *   Assessed the model's performance on the test set using key classification metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
    *   Visualized the results with a Confusion Matrix.

### üìä Key Insights from EDA

The exploratory analysis revealed several strong indicators of churn:

*   **Contract Type:** Customers on a `Month-to-month` contract churn at a significantly higher rate than those on one or two-year contracts. This is the single strongest predictor.
![Churn by Contract Type](img/churn_by_contract.png)
*   **Customer Tenure:** New customers (low tenure) are far more likely to churn. Loyalty increases dramatically over time.
*   **Internet Service:** Customers with `Fiber optic` internet service have a higher churn rate compared to those with DSL, suggesting potential issues with price, quality, or competition in that service tier.

### üå± Future Improvements

*   **Advanced Models:** Experiment with more complex models like `RandomForestClassifier` or `GradientBoostingClassifier` (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) which can capture non-linear relationships and potentially improve recall.
*   **Feature Importance Analysis:** Extract and visualize feature importances (or model coefficients) to provide the business with a clear, ranked list of churn drivers.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Implement `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to find the optimal hyperparameters for the best-performing model.
*   **Handle Class Imbalance:** Utilize techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or adjust class weights in the model to specifically address the imbalanced nature of the churn data and potentially boost recall.
